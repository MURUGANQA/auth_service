    name = String, nullable=False
    status = Integer, default=0, nullable=False

    settings = JSON, default={}, nullable=True
    created_at = BigInteger, nullable=True
    updated_at = BigInteger, nullable=True

    email = String, unique=True, nullable=False
    password = String, unique=False, nullable=False
    profile = JSON, default={}, nullable=False
    status = Integer, default=0, nullable=False
    settings = JSON, default={}, nullable=True
    created_at = BigInteger, nullable=True
    updated_at = BigInteger, nullable=True


Member
    org_id =
        Integer, ForeignKey"organisation.id", ondelete="CASCADE", nullable=False
   
    user_id = Integer, ForeignKey
        "user.id", ondelete="CASCADE", nullable=False
    role_id = Integer, ForeignKey
        "role.id", ondelete="CASCADE", nullable=False

APIs
Write these below shown apis in any Python Server (Framework is not important). Test the different scenarios and send us a github repo link along with the postman export collection

1) Sign in
	Verify User encrypted password in User table and
            Returns a JWT Token ( Access token and Refresh token)
2) Sign up
           Add an user entry
           Create a new organization (Get organization name and organization details as input )
           Add member entry with owner role
3) Reset password
4) Invite member
5) Delete member
6) Update member role

===============================
APIs for stats

1)  Role wise number of users
2) Organization wise number of members
3) Organisation wise role wise number of users
4) add from and to time filter and status filter to both APIs 3 and 4


Email APIs test
Use any Email API (twillio,resend, brevo etc). Email API is left to the candidateâ€™s choice

1) Send an invite email on sign up and invite with a generated link
2) Send an password update alert email
3) Send login alert event email
